So, my poem is quite a funny one, yet very easy to be read. I bet you will find it very easy to understand and appealing to read. Here is my poem:

In the fridge, I found a treat,
Leftovers from last night's feast.
With joy, I grabbed a fork and knife,
To taste that pizza slice of life.

But wait! My dog had a plan so sly,
Snatched the slice and ran right by.
Now I'm stuck with broccoli,
Oh, the woes of lunchtime mockery!
